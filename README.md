# Megacampy - A Full Stack Project 

MegaCampy is a campground website where you can add, delete, edit and give reviews to the Campround.

You can also create your own campround and set the price of your campground in our MegaCampy website.

In this website I used Authentication , Authourization, Passport, Cloudinary  to store images, MongoDb to store the user information.
